# Music Generating through the implementation of Markov chains

This is a project done for the Algorithms and AI Lab (BSCS2012) course of the University of Helsinki.

The main idea behind the project is to implement a model which will generate original, decently complex melodies using ABC notation. This is done with the use of Markov Chains and tries as the main data structure.
The code for this project is written in Java.

In the documentation folder, you can find further information about the project:
- ## Specification document:
  In the specification document you will find everything about the scope of the project and the ideas behind it. This document was done before starting with the project itself.
- ## Implementation document:
  In the implementation document you will be able to get more familiar with the overall structure of the code, and the details of the project's implementation.
- ## User guide:
  The user guide is an in-detail guidance for the setup needed to run the project, as well as the guidance for using and running the application itself.
- ## Testing document:
  The testing document provides information about the code coverage, and the ways of testing the implementation.
- ## Weekly reports:
  Through the weekly reports, you can familirize yourself with the process of the realization of this project, and see how was the project progressing and what changes were made along the way.
