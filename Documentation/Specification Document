# Specification Document

## Programming languages

I plan to mainly use  Python for this project due to its extensive libraries and community support for machine learning and computer vision tasks. Additionally, I may use C++ or C for performance optimization if necessary.

## Algorithms and data structures to be implemented

The primary algorithm I am implementing is the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. I will also be using some basic image processing techniques for data preparation and augmentation. Common data structures such as arrays, lists, and dictionaries will be utilized for handling image data and annotations.

## What problem is solved?

I am addressing the challenge of detecting elementary geometric shapes (such as circles, triangles, and rectangles) in real-world images to create artistic abstract representations. This project will contribute to the understanding of computer vision techniques and their application in creative fields.

## Taken inputs and how are they used

The program will take images gathered from various sources. The images will be annotated so that the locations of the objects, or in this case, the geometrical shapes, will be indicated.

## Desired time and space complexity

While the specific time and space complexities may vary based on the implementation and the dataset, YOLO typically operates with a time complexity of O(1) due to its architecture, which is the complexity I aim for.  The space complexity mostly depends on the model's parameters and the input image size, but minimizing memory usage is another goal of mine. Achieving real-time detection is also the aim of this project.
