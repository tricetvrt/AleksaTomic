# Weekly Report 1

This week, I focused on conducting in-depth research into the field of algorithmic music generation and exploring my specific interests within it. Although I have not done any practical work, I feel much more confident than I did in the beggining. Here are the main points of my progress:

## Researching topics

Finding a suitable project topic was more challenging than I had anticipated. Given my deep interest in various forms of creative work, along with my appreciation for the philosophical aspects of AI, I knew I wanted to explore something related to creative tools. Initially, I considered working with object or edge detection models. However, after consultations with the course assistant and professor, my focus gradually shifted toward the use of Markov chains for music production. Since this would be my first AI-related project, I wanted to choose something manageable that would also serve as a foundation for further research, yet still be ambitious.

## Project subject

I have chosen to develop a Markov chain-based system in Java for generating musical melodies. This project will use abc notation as a structured format for training data and allow users to select the degree of Markov chain complexity, adjusting the level of randomness and repetition in the generated melodies. By recognizing certain patterns, the goal for the generated melody is to be a coherent yet experimental piece that reshapes the traditional concept of what a melody should sound like.

## Project plan:

### - preparing data and setting

A foundational step is gathering abc notation files to serve as training data. Preparing the data will involve ensuring that the music files are varied and representative of the kinds of melodies I aim to generate, but still consistent so the model is able to learn patterns properly.

### - setting up the environment

I will ensure that my Java environment is proper for working with Markov chains and abc notation libraries. Additionally, I'll prepare any other tools needed for handling musical data.

### - implementing the Markov chains

The core of the project involves implementing Markov chains to model musical transitions. This will require creating suitable data structures, like tries, to efficiently store and retrieve music sequences, and implementing the functions and algorithms needed.

### - training and evaluating the model

The model of course needs to be trained on th prepared abc notation data set and the training process monitored. After that, evaluating and checking the model's accuracy and performance is crucial.

### - creating tests and testing

I will design tests to check the model’s ability to generate melodies at various levels of Markov chain complexity. Then I will test the model using both the created automated tests and subjective listening.

### - ui design

Toward the end of the project, I plan to create an intuitive user interface that allows users to adjust the complexity of the generated melodies and listen to the output in real-time.

## Current problems and dilemmas

There aren't many problems or dilemmas currently, thanks to the help and guidance I’ve received from the course assistant. However, I don't feel extremely confident yet, which is completely normal and leaves room for growth.

## - Next steps 

Next week, I plan to gather abc notation data and set up the necessary Java environment for working with Markov chains. I will also study existing abc notation libraries to understand how to best integrate them with my project. I also plan to have started coding by the end of the week.
