# Weekly Report 1

## Introduction

Having spent 6 hours on the project this first week, I didn't want to start coding straight away. In fact, I preferred to devote this week to finding a project and understanding how to set it up. So during this week I was able to do the following steps.

## Researching topics

Finding a suitable project topic was more challenging than I had anticipated. Given my deep interest in various forms of creative work, along with my appreciation for the philosophical aspects of AI, I knew I wanted to explore something related to creative tools. Initially, I considered working with Markov chains to implement them for music production. However, my focus gradually shifted toward computer vision concepts. Since this would be my first AI-related project, I wanted to choose something manageable that would also serve as a foundation for further research, yet still be ambitious. As I gathered numerous inspiring project ideas, I realized I should start with a simpler yet fundamental concept in computer vision engineering.

## Project subject

I have chosen to pursue an object detection project using the YOLO algorithm, as it serves as a crucial introductory step in learning computer vision. Initially, my idea was to focus on basic interior object detection. However, I have since become interested in applying the algorithm to more abstract concepts. My goal is to train a model that can recognize elementary geometric shapes in real-world environments, creating an artistic, abstract representation of reality. Although I considered using OpenCV for its simplicity in detecting geometric shapes, I ultimately decided on YOLO for its capability to extend into more complex shapes. I am still open to refining this topic after consulting with my professor.

## Project plan:

### - preparing data and setting

The first step would be preparing the proper data and ensuring that it includes diverse examples with different lightining, backgrounds and angles. After that, using annotation tools, highlighting the objects I would want to be detected is essential.

### - setting up the environment

Ensuring I have all the necessary environments installed and the proper version of the algorithm.

### - training and evaluating the model

The model of course needs to be trained and the training process monitored. After that, evaluating and checking the model's accuracy and performance is crucial.

### - implement real-time detection

Using a camera, after training and evaluating the model I would like to implement real-time detection.

### - generating diverse artistic expression

If possible, I aim to develop a method of transforming the detected shapes into artistic expression by overlaying the shapes detected over the real-time capturing. This could be extended and use for diverse expressions.

### - testing the model

Testing the implementation in various environments will showcase any possible mistakes and help me perfect the model.

## Current problems and dilemmas

Although I would like this project to be realized, I am not sure if it is too complex or even too simple for the scope of the course. I would need more consultation with the professors about the topic and the way of implementation. I would also need some time to improve my knowledge in Python, since I have not had any Python courses at my home university but learned that it is the best for YOLO implementation. 

## - Next steps 

Next week, I plan to begin gathering data and setting up the environment along with the YOLO algorithm. I will also familiarize myself with annotation tools and conduct a deeper dive into the YOLO algorithm, as I believe a solid theoretical understanding is essential. I'm extremely excited about this project and look forward to working on it, as it is a topic of deep interest to me.
