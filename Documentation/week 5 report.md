# Weekly report 5

This week, I set up Maven and JUnit for my project. I implemented JUnit tests for my methods and used them to identify and fix errors in my code. Additionally, I completed a peer code review. I have planned to finish some other things, but still I have done a lot of cruical work. Here are the brief points of my progress:

## Setting up Maven and JUnit

Although I have manually tested my code so far, my goal this week was to implement unit tests for all my existing methods. To achieve this, I had to set up the necessary tools.

## Unit tests

I have implemented a test class for each of my existing classes and written tests for all the methods created so far. I included as many edge cases as possible, along with tests for invalid inputs. For methods where I thought it was necessary, I implemented multiple tests to ensure detailed coverage. This approach makes testing better organized and helps in spotting logical errors in the code more efficiently. After running the tests, I found that while manual testing had already helped me fix many potential errors, the tests made it much easier to identify and address any remaining issues.

## Fixing the identified errors

The created unit tests provided essential feedback on my code. They helped me cover a wide range of possible inputs and outcomes in a much more organized way. After detecting the errors, I modified and fixed the methods which generated them. I am glad that I chose to first finish unit testing and than to continue with other things.

## Adjusting the code structure

The peer review has motivated me to better organize my code, and divide the methods to the according classes. I have also tried to make some methods more compact, and optimized the code. Still, I would need to do more adjusting in the future

##  Gathering some more data

Although I am not close to completing my training dataset, I have continued to slowly gather the data this week.

## Current problems and dilemmas

I do not seem to have any problems or dilemmas at the moment. If I do, I will reach out to the course assistant.

## Next week 

Next week I aim to complete my rhythm generation, since I did not manage to do it this week. I plan to complete my dataset and decide on the final interface idea to be implemented.
